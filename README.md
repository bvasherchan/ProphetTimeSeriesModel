# Business problem and project objective.
Maverick needs an accurate daily forecast of sales KPIs for a new store's first year of sales. Achieving this allows for more effective financial planning and accurate ROI documents. This project will be a success if it is able to yield a better forecast than the current model. Stakeholders will measure success with error rate (MAPE) and RMSE. This is a supervised regression problem where the predictors involve both categorical and numerical variables, and the target are four sales metrics.
